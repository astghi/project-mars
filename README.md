earth time to Mars calculator

One of the fundamental problems of space missions is a time synchronization between Earth and Space. The time on Mars and Earth is ticking differently and it is necessary to keep it under control. 

This receives the time on Earth in UTC as an input and return two values: the Mars Sol Date (MSD) and the Martian Coordinated Time (MTC).
